# Adventures with LLMs

## Setup

#### Create and activate the virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv venv

# This command is different for Mac and Linux (look it up)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

All dependencies are in your `requirements.txt`. Install them after activating your virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
